> A note-taking application that knows programmers and Markdown better.

[VNote](https://tamlok.github.io/vnote) provides fancy Markdown experience as well as powerful notes management.

VNote is **open source** and currently mainly developed and maintained by one single person in spare time. Hence, please don't hesitate to give VNote a hand if she does improve your productivity.

## Troubleshooting Guide
VNote could be used in two ways:

1. Note-taking application via notebooks, folders and notes. VNote manages all the data and provides additional functionality such as attachment and tag.
2. Editor. VNote provides the explorer for local file system to open external files to edit.

Steps to troubleshoot:

1. Go through the context menu, menu bar, tool bar, settings, and help menu to check if you miss something;
2. Changes to configuration may need re-opening current tabs or restarting VNote;
3. There is a Markdown guide and shortcuts guide in the help menu, which might be helpful;
4. Do a quick search in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tamlok/vnote/issues) and VNote's [Documentation](https://tamlok.github.io/vnote/en_us/#!docs/_vnote.json);
5. Post an issue *in detail* on GitHub to ask for help.

<mark>One More Thing</mark>: If you do not know what is Vim, please do not turn on Vim mode in the settings dialog. 😁 By the way, Vim is really a magic tool to improve edit efficiency. Highly recommend Vim mode and VNote's shortcuts. You won't regret it.

Now, how about pressing `Ctrl+G` and start today's work from **Universal Entry**?

Have fun!
